## 📌 Abstract

This project aims to create a food ordering system where customers can place orders at restaurants using mobile devices. By scanning a QR code at their table, customers access the restaurant’s menu, select items, and place their orders directly from their mobile phones. Orders are sent to the kitchen, and the customer receives a bill on their device.

The system is built using Java (AWT and Swing), JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python. This solution improves order accuracy, reduces staff workload, and enhances customer experience by eliminating wait times and human error.

## 🧠 Motivation

- **Time-saving**: Avoid long queues and reduce manual workload for staff.
- **Convenience**: Users can browse menus and place orders from their phones.
- **Independence**: Customers can order freely without needing a waiter.

## ❓ Problem Statement

In modern fast-paced environments, customers often face delays in ordering food at restaurants. The proposed system eliminates the dependency on staff by enabling direct ordering through mobile phones. This ensures faster service, better comfort, and cost-effectiveness for both customers and restaurants.
